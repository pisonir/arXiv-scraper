# arXiv_scraper

This python script asks the user for a keyword.
Then it looks for the latest arXiv publications that include the keyword in the title.
Finally, the user can download the .pdf files directly from a popup window.

The script uses the tkinter package and the Beautiful Soup library for the GUI and the html parsing, respectively.
